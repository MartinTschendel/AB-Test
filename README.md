# AB-Test
Conducting an AB-Test for an e-commerce website

## Background
This project was conducted within the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br><br>

It analyses the conversion rate of two different groups (treatment and control),<br> 
what receive two different versions of the website (old and new page).<br><br>

For the analysis, I used an A/B-Test and regression models.

## Request to improve project results

To go above and beyond, I would like to add the influences associated with time on conversion. In adding this variable to my analysis, it would be best to create dummy variables for different aspects of the time. Correctly coding and interpreting the results related to time along with the existing effects would benefit the analysis.
