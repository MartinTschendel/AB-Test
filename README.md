# AB-Test
Conducting an AB-Test for an e-commerce website

## Background
This project was conducted within the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.<br><br>

It analyses the conversion rate of two different groups (treatment and control),<br> 
what receive two different versions of the website (old and new page).<br><br>

For the analysis, I used an A/B-Test and regression models.
